Paperspace Deployment

# Intro
It is desirable that the deployment process on paperspace is documented. Especially hurdles and easy steps setting the environment up shall be highlighted.

## Ideas
• Maybe deploy code via docker containers.
• Test images locally and deploy to Paperspace instances
• This might help in that moving from one instance to another is trivial if GPU is ever to be upgraded.

## Infrastructure
• Docker
• Docker Hub
• (Github)
• Paperspace Gradient

your note just use Vim’s :write or :update commands, a filename will be picked
automatically based on the title.
